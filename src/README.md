Bosco Images Wildlife Photography: website began as a way to complete The Odin Project's "Dynamic User Interface Interactions" lesson (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-dynamic-user-interface-interactions), which required learning how to create a drop-down menu and an image carosel. I kept the project going for much longer than anticipated so I could also use it to complete the Advanced HTML/CSS lessons on responsive design and web accessibility.
